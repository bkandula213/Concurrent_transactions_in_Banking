# Concurrent_transactions_in_Banking
  The data-collection instrument for this study will be a survey that will be administered
to the sample population. The survey will consist of questions related to the participants'
experiences with online and mobile banking services, including the ease of use, reliability,
and transaction processing speed. The survey will be developed based on previously 
validated instruments and will be tested for validity and reliability. The number of items in
each scale and subscales will be clearly indicated.
  The key method/procedure used in this study will be a survey administered to the
sample population. The survey will be distributed electronically to the participants using
online survey tools. The survey will be designed to be completed within 10-15 minutes. The
design rationale for using a survey is to collect quantitative data that can be analyzed
statistically to draw conclusions about the performance of existing banking systems that offer
concurrent simultaneous transactions.
  The data collected from the survey will be analyzed using statistical methods such as
descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. The research questions
will be addressed using the results of the data analysis.
Limitations:
  The limitations of this research project include the possibility of response bias, where
participants may not provide honest and accurate responses to the survey questions. Another
limitation is the reliance on self-reported data, which may not always be reliable.
Additionally, the study is limited to customers of major banks in a specific geographic
location, and the findings may not be generalizable to other populations or regions.
